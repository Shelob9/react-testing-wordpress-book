## What Is Inside

In the first part, I'll show you how to test a React app. The app itself is super basic, and has a single feature. React is atomic. You can use this mini-app or its components in a larger app. For example a WordPress block. That's part two, I'll show how to use re-usable React components in a WordPress block.

## Assumptions About You

It's important as you consume this material to know what assumptions I'm making about you.

- You know React basics. If not, I recommend:
  - The [React Getting Started Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
  - [This section](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2) of [The University of Helsinki's Free Intro Course on Modern JavaScript-based Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/).
- How to create a "Gutenberg" block in WordPress.
  - If you're new to block development, I recommend following along with the [block tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/tutorials/block-tutorial/) in the handbook and building some blocks.
  - Also, [take at my slides and example code](https://github.com/Shelob9/block-worskshop) for my intro to block development workshop.
- You can read the docs.
  - I am going to be covering a lot of tools and moving quickly. I'll show how to get started with them and expalin WHY you would use them. I trust that you can discover the little details and next steps from reading the docs and considering what your code needs.
